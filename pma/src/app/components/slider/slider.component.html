          <h1>About developer</h1>
          <p class="avatar"><img class="right-img" src="../../../assets/avatar.jpg" >My name is Dilbar Akkaya.  Iâ€™m currently learning Web Development. I have no experience on front-end developmet. My goal is to become a front-end development specialist. The skills and experience acquired in other fields and my personal qualities, purposefulness, a strong desire to learn, self-develop, easy to adapt to different conditions, discipline, motivation, will help in achieving the goal. I choose frontend because I really like it when I can instantly see the result of my work. On my <a href="https://github.com/DilbarAkkaya"> GitHub page </a> you can see other projects created within the school</p>
